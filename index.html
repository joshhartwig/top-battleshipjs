      <p class="about_para">This game is my iteration of the Battleship Project from The Odin Project. To play the game, simply select the sqaures you want your ships
        to be placed on the board to the right. Once you place 5 ships, the AI will place 5 ships and you may begin playing. A word about bugs... there are many. The functionality for vertical ship
        placement exists. I felt like I spent way to much time on this project. Something that should have been possible in a week took me about 2 to 3 months because I
        dragged ass and skipped around at different content. I finally got to the point where I felt my code was 'good enough' and it was time to move on to other projects.
        I may revisist this one in the future and fix all the broken stuff.
